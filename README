All code in this project was tested on chuck

The current directory contains three subdirectories, each of 
which concerns a seperate part of the project.

The first of these is Basic_Greeks_Calculations, which contains a set  of programs and 
code snippets enumerating some of the standard methods used for
option pricing and the calcultation of greeks, including a finite
difference solver, a Monte Carlo method and an analytic solution
for a European option. This directory also contains a code snippet
containing the application code for the same calculation using 
adjoint differenciation.

The second subdirctory contains three subdirectories. Adjoint_Code and Tangent-Linear_Code
concern their respective models while Basic_Forward_Mode provides an alternate and somewhat
neater implementation of the tangent-linear model using dual numbers.

The final subdirectory is MLMC, whichconcerns an implementation of multilevel Monte Carlo.
The directory includes a Makefile to build the program. A seperate README file is provided
in this section detailing important functions.
